# SayChef

## What is it

Imagine you are in the kitchen with flour already on your hands and you need to look up a recipe. This app is for you.

## Design

The program uses the Houndify API to understand what you say and then searches through an online database of recipes using an API from Yummly to get ingredients instructions.

## About

Jono Sanders, [David Keller](https://davidkeller.me) and Sarah Schechter designed and developed Say Chef during [PennApps XIII](http://pennapps.com) in the Spring 2016 at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu).
